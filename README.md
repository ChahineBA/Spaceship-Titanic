# 🚀 Spaceship Titanic - Predicting Passenger Survival 🌌

This project is inspired by the **Spaceship Titanic** challenge, where the goal is to predict whether passengers aboard the spaceship survived or were transported to another dimension 🛸. Using advanced classification techniques, this project explores survival prediction based on various passenger attributes.

## Key Features 🌟
- 🛠️ **Feature Engineering**: Created new features from existing data (e.g., family size, cabin location) and transformed categorical variables into numeric values to boost model performance.
- 📊 **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and handled missing data to ensure quality inputs for the model.
- 🤖 **Modeling**: Applied different classification models to predict outcomes, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
- ⚙️ **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used Grid Search to optimize the models and improve prediction accuracy.
- 🎨 **Visualizations**: Created charts and plots to understand the data and prediction results.

Join the adventure and explore how machine learning can help predict who survived the mysterious **Spaceship Titanic** journey! 🚀🌠
